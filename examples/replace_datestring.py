# doydl's Temporal Parsing & Normalization Engine — dately
#
# The `dately` module is a deterministic engine for parsing, resolving, and normalizing
# temporal expressions across both natural and symbolic language contexts — built for NLP
# workflows, cross-platform date handling, and fine-grained temporal reasoning.
#
# Designed with formal grammatical rigor, `dately` interprets phrases like “first five days of next month,”
# “Q3 of last year,” and “April 3” — handling cardinal/ordinal resolution, anchored structures, and
# ambiguous or implicit references with linguistic sensitivity.
#
# The engine combines structured tokenization, symbolic transformation, and rule-based semantic
# composition to support precision across tasks such as entity recognition, information extraction,
# and temporal normalization in noisy or informal text.
#
# It guarantees invertibility, transparency, and cross-platform consistency, resolving platform-specific
# formatting differences (e.g. Windows vs. Unix) while maintaining NLP-grade flexibility for English-language
# temporal constructions.
#
# Whether embedded in intelligent agents, ETL pipelines, or legal/medical NLP systems, `dately` brings
# clarity and structure to temporal meaning — bridging symbolic logic with real-world language.

# Set variables
datestring = "2023-06-21"
datestring_list = [
    '2023-06-21', '2024-06-21', '2024-07-21', '2024-08-20',

### Replacing Datestring
# Replacing year in a single date string
print(dtly.replace_datestring(datestring, year=2021))
# Output: '2021-06-21'
# Replacing month in a single date string
print(dtly.replace_datestring(datestring, month="5"))
# Output: '2023-5-21'
# Replacing day in a list of date strings
print(dtly.replace_datestring(datestring_list, day=6))
# Output: ['2023-06-6', '2024-06-6', '2024-07-6', '2024-08-6', '2024-09-6', '2024-10-6', '2024-11-6', '2024-12-6', '2025-01-6', '2025-02-6', '2025-03-6', '2025-04-6']
# Replacing day in a Pandas Series of date strings
print(dtly.replace_datestring(datestring_series, day="02"))
# Output:
# 0     2023-06-02
# 1     2024-06-02
# 2     2024-07-02

### Replacing Datetimestring
# Replacing time components in a single date string
print(dtly.replace_timestring(datestring))
# Output: '2023-06-21 15:17:47.50691'
print(dtly.replace_timestring(datestring, hour=13))
# Output: '2023-06-21 13:17:47.56700'
print(dtly.replace_timestring(datestring, hour="02"))
# Output: '2023-06-21 02:17:47.63773'
print(dtly.replace_timestring(datestring, hour="02", minute=11))
# Output: '2023-06-21 02:11:47.69779'
print(dtly.replace_timestring(datestring, hour="02", minute=10, second=44))
# Output: '2023-06-21 02:10:44.75777'
print(dtly.replace_timestring(datestring, hour="02", minute=10, second=44, microsecond=1))
# Output: '2023-06-21 02:10:44.00001'
print(dtly.replace_timestring(datestring, hour="02", minute=10, second=44, microsecond=1, time_indicator="AM"))
# Output: '2023-06-21 02:10:44.00001 AM'
# Replacing time components in an ISO date string
iso_datestring = "2023-06-21T12:30:00Z"
print(dtly.replace_timestring(iso_datestring, hour=2, minute=10, second=44, microsecond=1))
# Output: '2023-06-21T02:10:44.000001+00:00'
